### Hi there 👋

I'm an expert in high availability, real-time Microservices. I currently provide consulting services as Solution Architect and lead technically agile teams. I am interested in teaching and developing Distributed Systems in Microservices, Cloud Computer and Distributed Architecture. I love to learn new things and always look for ways to contribute in any and every possible way.
